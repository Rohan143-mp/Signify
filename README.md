# ✋🤟 Signify — Real-Time Sign Language to Speech & Text

**Finalist project at Code Strom Hackathon 2025 | DIT University, Dehradun | Social Impact Theme**

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**Signify** is a real-time Sign Language Recognition System that bridges communication gaps for the deaf and mute community. It captures hand signs through a webcam, detects gestures for letters **A–Z** and special signs, and instantly translates them into text and speech — enabling seamless communication between signers and non-signers.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Millions of deaf and mute individuals use sign language to express themselves, but most people around them can’t understand it. This communication barrier creates daily challenges. **Signify** tackles this problem by providing an accessible, real-time translation system to promote inclusivity.

## 🗝️ Key Features  
✅ Real-time hand landmark detection using **MediaPipe**  
✅ Custom-trained **Random Forest Classifier** on a self-built dataset  
✅ Instant text and text-to-speech output  
✅ Web-based system using **Flask**, accessible via any browser  
✅ Plans for mobile app integration with **TensorFlow Lite**

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  

**Languages & Libraries:**  
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)  
- Flask (backend)  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend)  
- Pickle (model serialization)

**Tools:**  
- VS Code (IDE)  
- Git & GitHub (version control)

## 📊 Dataset & Model  

- **Custom Dataset:** Captured using webcam and MediaPipe hand landmarks (21 points, flattened to 42 features per sample). Multiple samples per class for signs **A–Z** and special gestures.  
- **Preprocessing:** Normalized landmarks and labeled data points.  
- **Model:** RandomForestClassifier trained with scikit-learn and serialized as `model.p`.  
- **Innovation:** Entire dataset built in-house for relevance and accuracy without relying on pre-trained models.

## 🖥️ How It Works  

1. Captures live webcam feed using **OpenCV**.  
2. Extracts hand landmarks in real time with **MediaPipe**.  
3. Normalizes and feeds landmarks into the trained model.  
4. Displays the predicted sign on screen and generates speech output.  
5. Accessible via a simple **Flask** web interface.

## 📱 Future Scope  

✨ **Mobile App:** Develop a responsive app with **TensorFlow Lite** + MediaPipe for on-device detection.  
✨ **Two-Way Communication:** Add voice/text input to generate sign language animations (reverse translation).  
✨ **Continuous Learning:** Integrate user feedback to improve prediction accuracy over time.  
✨ **Regional Support:** Expand to multiple regional sign languages.
